## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public methods and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Example:

```python
def calculate_total_sales(sales_data: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the total sales amount from a DataFrame.
    
    Args:
        sales_data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing sales data with 'amount' column
        
    Returns:
        float: Total sales amount
        
    Raises:
        KeyError: If 'amount' column is not found in DataFrame
    """
    if 'amount' not in sales_data.columns:
        raise KeyError("'amount' column not found in sales data")
    
    return sales_data['amount'].sum()
```

### Code Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Separate concerns into different modules
- Use meaningful file and directory names
- Avoid circular imports

## üß™ Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Example Test:

```python
def test_ingest_csv_creates_table(self):
    """Test that ingesting CSV creates a new table"""
    # Arrange
    csv_path = "test_data/sample.csv"
    table_name = "test_table"
    
    # Act
    result = self.analytics.ingest_csv(csv_path, table_name)
    
    # Assert
    self.assertTrue(result)
    self.assertIn(table_name, self.analytics.list_metadata())
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_duckdb_analytics.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_duckdb_analytics.py::TestDuckDBAnalytics::test_connect -v
```

## üîÄ Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - If you're adding new features, update the relevant documentation
2. **Add tests** - Ensure your changes are covered by tests
3. **Update README** - If necessary, update the README.md
4. **Run all tests** - Make sure all tests pass
5. **Update CHANGELOG** - Add a note about your changes (if applicable)
6. **Request review** - Request review from maintainers

### PR Title Format
